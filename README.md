A collection of scripts and files necessary for the creation of the Defense Solutions Air C2 COP project.

The Air Operations Command and Control Common Operating Picture is a gallery of maps and apps for an Air Operations Officer to maintain a common operating picture for command and control. These include a 3D web application built in Web AppBuilder for situational awareness and analysis, an operations dashboard for real-time awareness and decision making, and story map journals to brief pre- and post-action. These applications all reference a central web map and web scene integrated with other real-time data inputs analyzed using GeoEvent Extension.
